<h2>Weatherloo</h2>
Weatherloo is a simple Chrome extension that displays weather information for Waterloo, ON.

The current weather information is pulled from the [weather station](http://weather.uwaterloo.ca) at the University of Waterloo.

The forecast information is pulled from the [OpenWeatherMap](http://openweathermap.org/) API.

The icons used are called WeatherCons(TWO) and can be found on the [xda-developers forum](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1922149).

The interface of this extension was inspired by [The Weather Network](http://www.theweathernetwork.com/weather/canada/ontario/waterloo) and the [AccuWeather](http://www.accuweather.com/) mobile app.
